These are the instructions on how to run LAND's Midterm activity as well as check the sourcecodes.
NOTES: The containing folder of this text file contains two more folders namely LAND-JAR and LAND-midtermsourcecodes.
LAND-midtermsourcecodes contains all the source codes used to create LAND.jar. LAND-JAR contains the runnable jar file for this activity
plus the input.txt used to test our program.
You must be on atleast Java SE 1.8 and JDK 8 to be able to run this program (latest).

To run LAND.jar, follow the instructions below:

OPTIONAL *
* Copy the folder LAND-JAR (The folder containing LAND.jar and input.txt) to your desktop. This would make it easier for you to go
to the folder in the command prompt and then run the jar file.

INSTRUCTIONS
1.) Replace input.txt in the LAND-JAR folder with the proper input.txt that will be used for testing.
2.) Open your Command Prompt (cmd).
3.) In the command prompt, change the file path to LAND-JAR (go to the LAND-JAR directory). If you placed the folder on your desktop, the file path should look
	like C:>Users>[your user name]>Desktop>LAND-JAR> in the command prompt.
4.) type in the following to run LAND.jar in the command prompt:
	java -jar LAND.jar
5.) The program should run and you will get the answers for each of the expressions!
